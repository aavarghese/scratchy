//! `LoweringInput` — flat, topologically-ordered, backend-agnostic
//! description of a solved forward.
//!
//! One [`OpDesc`] per op, each naming its kind, row count, and inputs
//! (either a prior op's output or an external source — a
//! weight/activation/extern). It is deliberately a *plain data* mirror
//! of the macro crate's internal `Fuf` + solver `Assignment`: the
//! macro crate (which alone can see those types) does the trivial
//! structural translation and hands the result to
//! [`crate::subtile_ir::lower_region`], so all the decomposition logic
//! lives in this Mac-testable crate.
//!
//! [`fuse_silu_mul`] is a pre-pass that fuses adjacent `Silu` → `Mul`
//! into [`LoweredOp::SiluMul`] before lowering — the GPU has only the
//! fused arm, so fusion must happen before scheduling places the pair
//! on workers.
//!
//! Slated for deletion in plan §4 commit 7 (when `to_wavefront.rs`
//! builds [`crate::subtile_ir::SubtileIR`] directly).

//! ONE FUNCTION, MANY OPS — the door for a KTIR producer whose function is a whole kernel.
//!
//! # THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES, AND WHOSE PROBLEM IT IS
//!
//! Every entry point in [`super::lower_ktir_to_superdsc`] reads a function's PARAMETER LIST as one
//! op's operands: [`super::lower_ktir_to_superdsc::split_out`] takes the parameter written by a
//! `ktdp.store` as the output, counts the rest as inputs, and refuses when the count is not the
//! body's arity. That is exact for a function that IS one op, which is what `KtirFunc` emits — one
//! program per model-graph node.
//!
//! It is not the only legitimate KTIR. **IBM's C++ toolchain — the reference KTIR producer — puts a
//! whole kernel in ONE function**: its own checked-in output has 3 `linalg.matmul` in one
//! `func.func` for a SwiGLU MLP and 12 in one for a decoder layer. KTIR itself says nothing about
//! how many ops a function holds; a `func.func` holds what it holds. So the arity check is a
//! property of these bodies, not of the IR, and a producer matching the reference shape is refused
//! by a crate that could serve it.
//!
//! # WHY THIS IS PURELY ADDITIVE
//!
//! Nothing here changes an existing entry point, `split_out`, or any assembler. The bodies take
//! `&[Region]` and filter it by `is_out`, so handing a body the regions of ONE OP satisfies
//! `split_out` unmodified. This module's whole job is to build those per-op lists:
//!
//! ```text
//!   regions()            per PARAMETER: view <- parameter,     then the FIRST tile over the view
//!   region_for_operand() per OPERAND:   load <- tile <- view <- parameter, and THAT tile
//! ```
//!
//! The second is strictly more precise. `regions()`'s own comment flags that "a program that tiles
//! one buffer many ways is not addressed through this field"; rooting the walk at the operand reads
//! the window the op actually takes, so that case stops needing a special path.
//!
//! # WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
//!
//! It recognises NOTHING. An op becomes a `Program` only where the mapping is 1:1 by op kind
//! (`linalg.matmul` -> `Matmul`, `math.exp` -> `Elementwise(Exp)`). It does not look for a silu
//! longhand, an rmsnorm shape or an online softmax; a producer that wants `SiluMul` states it by
//! calling that entry point itself. Anything with no 1:1 mapping is REFUSED BY NAME, because a
//! guessed node kind is a well-formed descriptor computing the wrong function.

/// rather than a convenience: the AIU has `OpFunc::Silu` as a primitive and KTIR's `math.*` set does
/// not, so a producer has no op to write it with and writes the longhand instead
/// ([`Program::SiluMul`]'s own doc says exactly this).
///
/// ⛔⛔⛔ AND LOWERING THE LONGHAND OP-BY-OP IS NOT A SLOWER ANSWER, IT IS A DIFFERENT ONE.
/// `test/fixtures/swiglu_mlp.py` delta 5 states it at the source: "Writing the activation any other
/// way still lowers, but as four plain SuperDSCs computing a DIFFERENT algorithm, to which the
/// derived tolerance would not apply." The device primitive is a sigmoid opaque over six constants;
/// five pointwise descriptors are not that function. So the choice is not "fuse or don't" — it is
/// "recognise it, or emit something whose numbers no tolerance covers". A green `dxp_standalone`

///   that happens to have the same op kinds in the same order. This is what makes it silu.
/// * **the added constant is exactly 1.0.** `sigmoid` is `1/(1+e⁻ˣ)`. Any other constant is a

///
/// # ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ AND THE KERNEL SLOT ITSELF IS `[k, n]` — THE PLAIN FORM NEEDS NO RELAYOUT
///
/// A first reading of this had the plain form as the exotic one, to be lowered by transposing B into
/// the "assumed" orientation with `OpFunc::Transpose`. That was wrong twice over, and both halves were
/// measured:
///
/// * **The device slot is in-rows.** [`crate::sdsc_abstract::StickLayout::kernel`] is `[in(K),
///   out(N)]` with `rows = k_in`, and `matmul` declares exactly that (`Stk::kernel(k, n_dev, ..)`) for
///   BOTH forms. `vcache_write_offset`'s doc states the same thing for the hardware-proven attention —
///   "the V cache … the VALUE bmm reads as a `[cap, hd]` KERNEL sticked on `hd` (`out`) … the kernel is
///   `[k=cap, n=hd]`" — and `attn.rs`'s value leg contracts the V cache WHERE IT LIES, no relayout, at
///   41 tok/s. `p @ V` IS this contraction. Its twin `kcache_kt_write_offset` is the other half of the
///   argument: the score leg's kernel is `[hd, cap]`, in-rows again, which is why the K cache is
///   written already-transposed rather than transposed on the way in.
/// * **The relayout could not have computed it anyway.** MEASURED on both decoders: the transposing
///   emission produced a `[128, 64]` intermediate and then declared the consuming kernel
///   `layoutDimOrder_ ["in","out"]` with `in_ = 64, out_ = 128` over it (baked `sdsc_32` / `sdsc_33`)
///   — a k-row/n-col reading of a buffer that physically had n rows. It moved the bytes AWAY from the
///   slot's own address law. dxp then refused to schedule it on `SENARCH=MPW4` ("Implicit syncs not
///   available for architectures prior to RCUDD1A"), which is the only reason the wrong answer was
///   never baked.
///
/// So a `[k, n]` B is contracted in place, and the transposition a `[n, k]` B needs is spent OUTSIDE

///
/// Stating `indexing_maps` LABELS which axis of `B` is `k`. It does not MOVE a byte. The kernel slot

/// consequence in the crate's own words — "`RowBlocked` vs `Kernel` is the identical stick-block

/// spent OUTSIDE the descriptor by one of exactly two agents:
///
///  * a PRESENTED weight — the HOST stage, once, at bake time (`stage_2d(&StickLayout::kernel(k, n),
///    ..)`, `sdsc_abstract.rs:2124`). Free at inference, and the whole regression bar is this case.
///  * a CACHE — the DEVICE, writing it already transposed (`kcache_kt_write_offset`), which is why the
///    shipped attention pays for a third physical Kᵀ plane (`assemble_restickify_kt_2d`) rather than
///    relabelling the one it has. **The relayout exists to MAKE a `[k, n]` buffer, never to consume
///    one.**
///
/// An IN-REGISTER COMPUTED value is NEITHER. Nothing stages it, no cache write orders it, and nothing
/// in this crate reads an access tile's `CoordinateOrder` (it occurs inside one comment and nowhere
/// else), so the transposing order a front end can set on the tile is never honoured. The descriptor
/// that comes out is well-formed and contracts `A @ B` instead of `A @ Bᵀ`.
///
/// ⛔ AND NO EXTENT GUARD CAN CATCH IT. `matmul`'s `w_k != k` / `w_n != n` checks read whichever of
/// the region's two extents this orientation names, so at `k == n` both framings pass — which
/// `decoder_block.py`'s two score matmuls (`tl.dot(q1r, k1r.T)` on `[64, 64]` RoPE results) are
/// exactly. That is why the refusal is stated on PROVENANCE, which the extents cannot express.
///
/// # WHAT THE PRODUCER DOES INSTEAD, AND WHY THIS IS NOT A DEAD END
///
/// A front end holding a `tt.trans` of a computed value must emit a REAL relayout beside the matmul —
/// a `linalg.transpose` reaching `Program::Transpose` — and then state NO maps, so the plain `[k, n]`
/// form reads a buffer that is physically `[k, n]`. `triton-ktir`'s `dot_to_linalg` does exactly that
/// as of this change: it folds a `.T` into the maps ONLY when the transposed value is a direct
/// `tt.descriptor_load`.
///
/// ⛔ THAT COSTS AN ARCH FEATURE THIS PATH DOES NOT HAVE ON MPW4, AND THE REASON IS NOW MECHANICAL
/// RATHER THAN OBSERVED. deeptools maps an opFunc to a DDL template per ISA
/// (`ddc/ddl/ddl_conversion.h`'s `opFuncToDdlTemplate`): `BATCHMATMUL_FWD` has a

        // ⭐ THE DEVICE EVIDENCE IS THE SHIPPED ATTENTION, AND IT IS THIS EXACT CONTRACTION.

        // exists to MAKE a `[k, n]` buffer, never to consume one.

        // ⛔⛔⛔ WHAT USED TO BE HERE, AND WHY BOTH OF ITS CLAIMS WERE WRONG. This site transposed B

        // measurements killed it:
        //   * IT COMPUTED THE WRONG THING. Baked on both decoders, `32_transpose_o41` wrote a
        //     `[128, 64]` tile (`primaryDsInfo_` OUTPUT `stickDimOrder_ ["out","mb"]`, the 8×8
        //     inter-slice block) and `33_matmul_o42` then declared its KERNEL `layoutDimOrder_
        //     ["in","out"]` with `in_ = 64, out_ = 128` over it — a k-row/n-col reading of a buffer that
        //     physically had n rows. The relayout moved the bytes AWAY from the slot's own address law;
        //     the un-transposed `[64, 128]` value was already exactly what that descriptor reads.
        //   * IT COULD NOT RUN. dxp refuses to schedule it on `SENARCH=MPW4` — "DtException: Implicit
        //     syncs not available for architectures prior to RCUDD1A, ddcv1.cpp line 3416" — at 16
        //     cores AND at 1 core, and identically when `OpFunc::Restickify` was substituted, so the
        //     limit is the DATA-STAGE CHANGE a relayout makes and not either primitive. Across all six

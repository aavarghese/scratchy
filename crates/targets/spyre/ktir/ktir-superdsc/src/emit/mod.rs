/// [`PageExtent::single_position`]. dxp then derives `skip_addr = 1 x the per-core extents of the
/// unpinned dims` = `cols`, i.e. one whole table row per index step, and the entries the host stages
/// are plain row numbers. That pin is the vendor fixture's own shape —
/// `zz_the_index_tensors_shape_is_the_paged_dims.rs` records `test_gather_1core` as
/// `value maxDimSizes_ [1,-1,-1]` against `index layoutDimOrder_ ["mb"]`, and its op is an `identity`,
/// not an attention.
///
/// ## ⛔ `cols` IS NOT LIMITED TO ONE STICK HERE, AND THAT IS NOT A WEAKENING OF `gather_copy_opspec`
/// That builder refuses `cols != 64` because ITS destination must be CONTIGUOUS: a matmul kernel then
/// reads the scratch per-batch at a stride dxp DERIVES, so a stick-major destination hands the score
/// kernel another request's slots (its own "WHY THE DESTINATION BEING CONTIGUOUS IS THE POINT"). This
/// op has no such consumer — its destination is an ordinary activation, written stick-major and read
/// stick-major by the rest of the model, which is what every other pointwise here emits. An embedding
/// row is `d_model` wide (4096 = 64 sticks) and must stay one row.
///
/// The half of that file's reasoning which DOES transfer is `skip_addr`, and it is enforced below.
///
/// ## ⛔ FALLIBLE, unlike its non-gathering siblings
/// They panic because they run inside scratchy's `#[forward]` proc-macro, where a panic IS the build
/// error. This door is reached from a third-party KTIR producer's driver, and every refusal below is a
/// statement about the PROGRAM rather than about this crate — so it returns them.
///
/// ## ⭐⭐⭐ AND IT RETURNS **MANY** OPS, BECAUSE ONE GATHER OP'S INDEX IS ONE STICK
/// The index reaches the L3LU IBR as a single `SenUint32` stick transfer
/// ([`crate::sdsc_abstract::CopyDims::ENTRIES_PER_OP`] entries), so a node with more entries than that
/// is emitted as one op per stick, each writing its own ROW WINDOW of the output in place — no scratch
/// and no relayout. The body carries the three card measurements that fixed that shape: what the
/// un-cut op did (`ids[r mod 32]`), what a row-major destination does (a PCIe bus fence), and which
/// wire field the window's stick-plane stride actually comes from (`N_`, not `maxDimSizes_`).

    // ⛔⛔⛔ AND THE CARD MEASURED IT THROUGH **THIS** DOOR, WHICH IS WHERE THE CUT BELOW COMES FROM.

    //
    // ⭐ AND IT PROVED THE REST OF THE EMISSION CORRECT, which is what made the remedy a CUT and not a

    // table row, the `Role::Index`/`SenUint32` declaration, the row-major residency a `mb`-pinned value
    // tensor implies, and the stick-major output were all already right. Only the ENTRY COUNT was
    // wrong.
    //
    // ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ THE CUT: ONE OP PER INDEX STICK, EACH WRITING A **ROW WINDOW** OF THE OUTPUT IN PLACE.
    //
    // Each leg declares `cap` entries (one IBR stick), reads index words `[k·cap, (k+1)·cap)` and
    // writes rows `[k·cap, (k+1)·cap)` of the output. MEASURED on the card, `emb256_rowwin_D`, all
    // eight row-blocks of `embedding_granite` against the fixture's own `ref_out.bin`:
    //
    //   rows[0:32] … rows[224:256]   within_2pct_strict = 1.000000   (131072 elements each)

    //
    // ⛔⛔⛔ AND TWO OTHER WAYS OF WRITING THAT WINDOW ARE ON THE RECORD AS WRONG, because each of them
    // is the obvious one and neither faults:
    //
    // (a) A **ROW-MAJOR SCRATCH** plus a `restickify` — the shape this refusal used to name. Forcing
    //     the leg's destination to address `Flat` gives a per-core start of `c·cols·2` (8192 B) while
    //     `stickDimOrder_` still says `out`, so the two disagree about every byte above one stick and
    //     the card raises `RAS::PCI::BusFence` 0xa35e ("PCIe bus master fence") at prepare — measured,
    //     deterministically, at segment 0 AND at segment 4 (so it is the addressing, not the segment)
    //     and with the restickify REMOVED (so it is not the relayout). The eight-leg bundle is
    //     otherwise byte-identical and runs.
    //
    // (b) Pinning the row count in **`maxDimSizes_`**. `[256, -1]` and `[256, 4096]` both run and both
    //     give `within_2pct_strict = 0.017013` over the whole tensor. Read off the card's own bytes:
    //     the row-window BASE is honoured (device run `32k` holds `ids[32k]`'s plane 0 for every k) and
    //     only the stick-PLANE stride is wrong — 32 rows instead of 256 — so leg `k`'s plane `s` lands
    //     at run `32·(k+s)` and run 512 held leg 7's plane 9, exactly as that predicts.
    //
    // ⭐⭐⭐ SO THE RESIDENCY EXTENT dxp RECONSTRUCTS FROM IS **`N_`**, AND THAT IS THE ONE THING A LEG
    // HAS TO SAY DIFFERENTLY. `maxDimSizes_ = -1` means "reconstruct the stick-blocked `device_size`
    // from `N_`/`layoutDimOrder_`/`stickSize_`", and it is `N_`'s `mb_` that the reconstruction reads —
    // so a leg's `N_` carries the OUTPUT TENSOR's row count while its WORK division
    // (`numWkSlicesPerDim_`, `dataStageParam_.ss_`/`el_`, the per-core starts 128 B apart, the index's
    // own 32-entry `N_`/`stickSize_`) carries the leg's own 32 rows. Everything else — including this

//! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ AN EMBEDDING-TABLE GATHER IS THE VENDOR'S OWN DECLARATION AT FULL ROW WIDTH.
//!
//! `table[ids[row], :]` is a row lookup: one index entry IS one table row. That is
//! `entry_dim: KernelAxis::Batch` with `PageExtent::single_position()` and no second paged axis —
//! the SAME pair `zz_the_gather_op_is_kernel_less.rs` names `VENDOR_DECL`, because
//! `dxp/test/test_gather_1core/sdsc_1.json`'s value tensor is `["mb","out","x"]` with
//! `maxDimSizes_ [1,-1,-1]` and its op is an `identity`, not an attention. So the marking a table
//! lookup needs is not an extension of the paged-KV gather; it is the narrower of the two cases the
//! one door already spans.
//!
//! ## What this file adds over that one
//! The GEOMETRY. `gather_copy_opspec` refuses `out != 64` because ITS destination must be contiguous
//! for a matmul kernel to read per-batch at a dxp-derived stride. An embedding's destination is an
//! ordinary activation — written stick-major, read stick-major — and its row is `d_model` wide:
//! granite's is 4096, i.e. 64 sticks. These assertions are at that width, against the descriptor the
//! pod bakes, so "the pin still means one row at 64 sticks" is measured rather than reasoned.
//!
//! ## ⛔ AND THE TWO FIELDS THAT ARE **NOT** THE SAME AS THE KV GATHER'S
//! * `primaryDsInfo_` is `{KERNEL_IDX, OUTPUT}` with NO `KERNEL` — `pointwise_broadcast_opspec_from_tile`
//!   types every operand `Role::Output`, which is what lets `emit_sdsc`'s KERNEL refusal pass. A
//!   pointwise gather is legal for exactly the reason a gathered matmul is not.
//! * The op has THREE data operands, not two, so the index's position is load-bearing in a way the
//!   2-operand fixtures cannot show. See `the_gathered_operand_must_be_the_last_input`.
//!
//! ## AND AT `ROWS = 256` THE DOOR NOW EMITS **EIGHT LEGS**, ONE PER 32-ENTRY INDEX STICK
//! One gather op's index is ONE `SenUint32` stick, so a 256-entry node is CUT. Every assertion below
//! is a property of ONE leg's descriptor and is read off leg 0; the leg count is asserted as a
//! function of [`CopyDims::ENTRIES_PER_OP`] rather than as a literal, so a change to that constant
//! moves the expectation instead of breaking the file. `mod gather_cut` in `emit/mod.rs` owns the
//! cut's OWN properties (the row window, the per-leg entry base, the residency `N_`).

//! IBM Spyre (KTIR) backend target for scratchy — the `-Fspyre` peer of
//! `crates/targets/{cuda,metal}`.
//!
//! The Spyre AIU executes per-bundle KTIR; there is no GPU device memory in the
//! CUDA/Metal sense, and the hardware-free path runs the same KTIR on the
//! `ktir-emulator` emulator. So the platform-specific seam the rest of scratchy needs
//! from a target — "allocate device memory and put these host bytes on it" — is,
//! for Spyre, a host malloc + memcpy. [`SpyreAllocator`] provides that as the
//! host impl of [`scratchy_tensors::DeviceAllocator`], so `GpuWeights` loads
//! weights through the exact same disk→host pipeline cuda/metal use, with no GPU
//! toolchain pulled in.

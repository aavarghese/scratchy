description: Metal benchmark matrix runs on a Mac. Use to run scripts/bench_metal_matrix.sh against mlx-lm, ollama, llama.cpp, vllm-metal, oMLX and mistral.rs on this Mac (a full run, or a quick smoke run to check the setup), or to add a finished run's JSON to the site's Metal page (site/data/metal).

# Metal benchmark run (one Mac → one JSON → the site)

Rung definitions and fairness rules are in `docs/BENCHMARKING.md`. The
script's flags are documented in its header (`--help`).

The run records its mistakes silently, as `repo.dirty`, `machine.power`, a
skipped engine or a commit that isn't upstream `main`, and every one of them
has landed on the site at least once. Each step below ends with a **Done
when** check. Meet it before you start the next step.

**Who runs what:** a `sudo` that asks for a password, or anything that opens
an editor, needs the user at a terminal. Give them the exact lines to run in
a separate terminal window, then wait until they say it's done. The agent
runs everything else.

**Two kinds of run:**
- A **full run** is what goes on the site: a whole round of models, every
  rung, every installed engine, all of them pinned, and default reps, priming
  and scaling. It takes hours. The default round is the MoE models
  (qwen3.6-35b-a3b, gemma-4-26b-a4b-it, glm-4.5-air); `--models full` adds the
  dense ones (qwen3.6-27b, gemma-4-31b-it), and `--models dense` runs those
  alone.
- A **smoke run** checks the setup. It runs gemma-4-26b-a4b-it only, the
  smallest model left, with one rep, no scaling and output in `/tmp`. Its
  JSON never goes on the site, so after step 4 you're done.

## 1. One-time setup (per Mac)

Install every comparison engine at the versions agreed for this round (the
pins in step 3). The script runs each one it finds and prints it as skipped
otherwise:

```bash
# mlx-lm in its own venv; the script finds it via $VIRTUAL_ENV
~/.venvs/mlx/bin/python -c 'import mlx_lm' 2>/dev/null \
  || { python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/mlx && ~/.venvs/mlx/bin/pip install -U mlx-lm; }
command -v ollama || brew install ollama           # the CLI, not the desktop app
command -v llama-server || brew install llama.cpp
command -v vllm || { brew tap vllm-project/vllm-metal https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-metal \
                     && brew install vllm-project/vllm-metal/vllm-metal; }
command -v mistralrs || curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EricLBuehler/mistral.rs/master/install.sh | MISTRALRS_INSTALL_TAG=<tag> sh
```

oMLX goes in from source, with its native kernels: a plain install (Homebrew
included) skips them, and the Qwen3.5/3.6 family then falls back to much
slower paths. Building them needs full Xcode, not only the Command Line Tools:

```bash
git clone --branch <tag> https://github.com/jundot/omlx ~/omlx && cd ~/omlx
python3.13 -m venv .venv && OMLX_WITH_CUSTOM_KERNEL=1 .venv/bin/pip install -e .
.venv/bin/python -c "from omlx.custom_kernels import native_kernel_status; print(native_kernel_status())"
ln -s ~/omlx/.venv/bin/omlx /opt/homebrew/bin/omlx   # the script looks for omlx on PATH
```

**Passwordless `purge`.** The frozen rung runs `sudo -n purge` throughout a
run that lasts hours. A cached `sudo -v`, even with a keepalive loop, expires
partway through. A one-time sudoers rule is the reliable fix. Have the user
run this in a separate terminal. It checks the rule with `visudo -c` before
installing it, because a broken file in `/etc/sudoers.d` breaks `sudo`
entirely:

```bash
echo "$(whoami) ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/purge" > /tmp/bench-purge
sudo visudo -cf /tmp/bench-purge && sudo install -m 0440 -o root -g wheel /tmp/bench-purge /etc/sudoers.d/bench-purge
```

Then check the rule the way the harness does, by asking sudo whether it may
run `purge` without a password (it lists the rule rather than running it).
`sudo -k` drops any cached unlock first, so a pass proves the rule itself
works. An older rule that also lists `/usr/bin/true` still works:

```bash
sudo -k && sudo -n -l /usr/sbin/purge >/dev/null && echo "rule works"
```

**Without the rule** (the user would rather not add it, or can't), pass
`--scenarios cold,warm` in step 3. Nothing then needs sudo, but the run has
no frozen rung, so treat it like any partial run in step 5.

**Done when:** `~/.venvs/mlx/bin/python -c 'import mlx_lm'` exits 0,
`command -v` prints a path for `ollama`, `llama-server`, `vllm`, `omlx` and
`mistralrs` (or the user has chosen to leave one out), oMLX's kernel status
shows them available, and the check prints `rule works` without asking for a
password, or the user has chosen to run without the frozen rung.

## 2. Pre-flight (every run)

Find the upstream remote. In a fork clone, `origin` is the fork, and its
`main` can be well behind upstream.

```bash
up=$(git remote -v | awk '/AI-native-Systems-Research\/scratchy(\.git)? \(fetch\)/ {print $1; exit}')
git fetch -q "$up" main
echo "HEAD $(git rev-parse --short HEAD) on $(git branch --show-current);" \
     "vs $up/main: $(git rev-list --left-right --count "$up/main...HEAD" | awk '{print $1 " behind, " $2 " ahead"}')"
git status --short
pmset -g batt | head -1
sysctl -n hw.memsize | awk '{print $1/2^30 " GB"}'
osascript -e 'quit app "Ollama"' 2>/dev/null   # the desktop app competes for memory
sleep 2; pkill -f '/Applications/Ollama.app/'  # quitting the app leaves its `ollama serve` on :11434
pgrep -fl 'bench_metal_matrix|scr bench|scr-|mlx_lm.(server|generate)|llama-server|vllm serve|omlx|mistralrs serve|caffeinate -dims'   # leftovers from an earlier run
lsof -nP -iTCP:8751 -sTCP:LISTEN               # the script's --port
```

- **Commit:** tell the user where `HEAD` is relative to upstream `main`
  (e.g. "on `skills`, 3 behind and 1 ahead"), and let them choose: benchmark
  this commit, or check out upstream `main` first. Stay on their branch
  unless they choose to switch. Only upstream `main` goes on the site
  without asking.
- **Dirty tree:** ask the user how to handle their changes. Leave the
  changes for them to commit or stash themselves.
- **On battery:** ask the user to plug in, then check again. Battery runs
  are throttled, and the JSON records the power source.
- **Leftovers:** if `pgrep` or `lsof` prints anything, an earlier run is
  still going or didn't clean up. Ask before stopping it (see **Stopping a
  run** under step 3).
- **Memory:** the script skips a model that can't fit and records why
  (`skipped: needs 64 GB, this Mac has 36 GB`), so the default round runs as
  is. glm-4.5-air (46.8 GB) runs only on a 64 GB Mac, at no more than 4 users
  at once. No model in the current rounds fits a 16 or 24 GB Mac: don't run
  there.
- **64 GB Macs:** GLM's longest cells need about 53 GB, above the GPU's
  default limit (about 48 GB). Ask the user to raise it to the agreed value
  with `sudo sysctl iogpu.wired_limit_mb=<MB>` (it resets on reboot); the
  run records it as `machine.gpu_wired_limit_mb`.
- **First run on this Mac:** it downloads the HF weights and ollama's models,
  so it needs internet.

**Done when:** the user has chosen the commit to benchmark,
`git status --short` prints nothing, `pmset` says `'AC Power'`, the
`pkill`/`pgrep`/`lsof` lines leave nothing running, and you've decided on
the `--models` flag (none for the default MoE round, or `--models full`).

## 3. Run

Full run. Pin every installed engine and scratchy's commit to the versions
agreed for this round, so all the Macs run the same thing; the script refuses
to start while any pin is missing or doesn't match, and lists what's wrong.
Names match in any case, scratchy's pin is a commit prefix, and llama.cpp's
is its build number:

```bash
source ~/.venvs/mlx/bin/activate
caffeinate -dims ./scripts/bench_metal_matrix.sh --fail-fast [--models full] \
  --pin scratchy=<sha> --pin mlx-lm=<v> --pin ollama=<v> --pin llama.cpp=b<build> \
  --pin vllm-metal=<v> --pin oMLX=<v> --pin mistral.rs=<v> 2>&1 | tee ~/metal-matrix-run.log
echo "exit ${PIPESTATUS[0]}"
```

`--unpinned` runs without pins and records that in the JSON (`pinned:
false`); use it only for a smoke run or a test the user asked for.

Smoke run (a few minutes when the builds are cached):

```bash
source ~/.venvs/mlx/bin/activate
caffeinate -dims ./scripts/bench_metal_matrix.sh --fail-fast --unpinned --models gemma-4-26b-a4b-it \
  --reps 1 --prime 1 --no-scaling --out-dir /tmp/metal-smoke 2>&1 | tee /tmp/metal-smoke.log
echo "exit ${PIPESTATUS[0]}"
```

The script exits 1 when a model got no scratchy numbers. `tee` would hide
that, which is why `PIPESTATUS[0]` is printed. `--fail-fast` stops at the
first scratchy build or parity-gate failure, instead of going on to the next
model.

Run the command in the background, so a full run doesn't hit a shell timeout,
and wait for it to finish. While it runs, watch the log for these lines and
act on each one as it appears:

- the engine lines in the header, one per engine (`llama.cpp : <path>
  (<version>)`): a `skipped` line under one means it isn't installed or
  `--engines` left it out. If it's an engine the user meant to run, stop the
  run and go back to step 1.
- `skipped: needs N GB`: expected for glm-4.5-air on a Mac under 64 GB.
- `BUILD FAILED`: the run stops by itself with `--fail-fast`. Go to **On a
  build failure** below.
- `PARITY FAILED`: scratchy's greedy answers didn't match mlx-lm's, so that
  model isn't timed, and the run stops with `--fail-fast`. The lines under it
  show both answers; `the ... child crashed` means one side crashed rather
  than disagreed. Report it to the user with the gate log
  (`raw/parity-<model>.log`).
- `json -> <path>`: the run has finished writing its JSON.

**On a build failure:** check whether it's a regression on `main` or a
problem on this Mac. Rebuild the same features at the commit of the newest
run on the site. The features are on the log's `--- build -F <features>`
line.

```bash
sha=$(ls site/data/metal/*.json | xargs -n1 python3 -c 'import json,sys; d=json.load(open(sys.argv[1])); print(d["generated_utc"], d["repo"]["sha"])' | sort | tail -1 | cut -d' ' -f2)
git worktree add /tmp/scratchy-known-good "$sha"
(cd /tmp/scratchy-known-good && cargo build --release -p scratchy-cli --features <features>)
git worktree remove /tmp/scratchy-known-good
```

The worktree starts from a cold cache, so this takes minutes. If it builds,
the failure is a regression on `main` since `$sha`. Tell the user, and point
them to the build log, the failing commit and the known-good one so they can
file an issue. If it fails too, the problem is with this Mac's toolchain.

**Stopping a run** (only when the user asks, or after a failed check):
stopping just the script isn't enough. It handles signals only between
steps, and the `scr bench` and server it started keep running. Stop all of
them:

```bash
pkill -TERM -f 'bench_metal_matrix.sh|scr bench (startup|serve)|mlx_lm.(server|generate)|llama-server|vllm serve|omlx|mistralrs serve|caffeinate -dims'
pkill -TERM -f ' chat -m .* --device metal'    # the parity gate's scratchy side
sleep 10
pgrep -fl 'bench_metal_matrix|scr bench|scr-|mlx_lm.(server|generate)|llama-server|vllm serve|omlx|mistralrs serve|caffeinate -dims'
lsof -nP -iTCP:8751 -sTCP:LISTEN -t | xargs kill 2>/dev/null   # whatever server the run started
```

**Done when:** the header shows a real path for every engine the user meant
to run, the log ends with a `json -> <path>` line, and `exit 0` is printed.

## 4. Check the JSON

Take the path from the run's own `json -> ...` line, not whichever file is
newest. For a smoke run, read `/tmp/metal-smoke.log` instead:

```bash
f=$(grep -o 'json -> .*' ~/metal-matrix-run.log | tail -1 | cut -d' ' -f3)
up=$(git remote -v | awk '/AI-native-Systems-Research\/scratchy(\.git)? \(fetch\)/ {print $1; exit}')
sha=$(python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(open(sys.argv[1]))["repo"]["sha"])' "$f")
if [ "$sha" = "$(git rev-parse "$up/main")" ]; then echo "commit  upstream main (tip)"
elif git merge-base --is-ancestor "$sha" "$up/main"; then echo "commit  upstream main, $(git rev-list --count "$sha..$up/main") commits behind its tip"
else echo "commit  NOT in upstream main"; fi
python3 - "$f" <<'EOF'
import json, sys
from collections import Counter
d = json.load(open(sys.argv[1])); c = d["config"]
print("chip   ", d["machine"]["chip"], "|", d["machine"]["power"])
print("repo   ", d["repo"]["sha"][:8], d["repo"]["branch"], "dirty=" + str(d["repo"]["dirty"]))
for e in c.get("engines") or []:
    print("engine ", f"{e['label']:16}", "installed=" + str(e["installed"]),
          e.get("version") or "-", "pin=" + (e.get("pin") or "-"))
print("pinned ", c.get("pinned"), c.get("pin_problems") or "")
for m in d["models"]:
    reps = Counter(r["scenario"] for r in m.get("cache_ladder") or [])
    print("model  ", m["stem"], "built=" + str(m.get("built")), "parity=" + str(m.get("parity_mlx_lm")), dict(reps))
for x in d.get("skipped_models") or []:
    print("skipped", x["stem"], x["reason"])
full = (c["scenarios"] == ["frozen", "cold", "warm"] and c["cold_priming_launches"] == 3
        and c["scaling"] is not None and not c["scratchy_serve_args"]
        and all(Counter(r["scenario"] for r in m.get("cache_ladder") or []).get("frozen") == 3
                for m in d["models"]))
print("scope  ", "full" if full else "PARTIAL (rungs, reps, priming, scaling or serve args not at defaults)")
EOF
```

**Done when:** you've reported every line to the user. These all have to
hold for a run to go on the site: `AC Power`, `dirty=False`, `installed=True`
for every engine the user meant to run, `pinned True` (each version equal to
its pin), and every model `built=True` and `parity=True`. A `skipped` model is
fine when its reason is memory. If any of them fails, report it and let
the user decide whether the run is usable. Report the `commit` and `scope`
lines too, but they don't fail the run on their own; step 5 asks about them.
A smoke run ends here.

## 5. Copy into the site

Before copying, ask the user to confirm if any of these is true:
- `scope` is `PARTIAL`
- the run has fewer models than the round it ran (the three MoE models, or
  all five with `--models full`), not counting a model skipped for memory
- `commit` isn't upstream `main`

Never copy a smoke run, or anything under `/tmp/metal-smoke`.

The site shows each chip's two newest runs, as current and previous, and
computes the ▲/▼ change badges from them. Add the new run, keep the run
before it as the previous one, and remove anything older. Copy first, and
prune only once the copy has worked: `cp -n` refuses to overwrite a run that
has the same name, and in that case nothing should be removed.

```bash
m=$(basename "$f" | sed -E 's/-[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}(T[0-9]{6}Z)?-[0-9a-f]{8}\.json$//')   # e.g. apple-m3-pro
if cp -n "$f" site/data/metal/; then
  ls site/data/metal/"$m"-*.json | sort | sed '$d' | sed '$d' | xargs -r git rm -q   # keep the newest two
else
  echo "$(basename "$f") is already in site/data/metal; nothing copied or removed"
fi
```

If it says the file is already there, show the user both files and let them
decide which one to keep.

**Done when:** `ls site/data/metal/$m-*` lists at most two files, and the
newest one is `$(basename "$f")`.

## 6. Preview

`site/open.sh` keeps serving until it's stopped, so run it in the background:

```bash
PORT=8001 site/open.sh    # then open http://localhost:8001/metal.html
```

If the build fails, it lists every problem in the data files. CI would fail
on the same ones, so fix them here.

**Done when:** the build succeeds, and `metal.html` shows this chip with the
new run's date and commit.

## 7. Share or commit

Either send the JSON to whoever collects the runs from all the Macs, or
commit it on a new branch and open a PR titled:

```
data(site): <machine> Metal run at <short-sha>
```

**Done when:** the user has the JSON or the PR link.
